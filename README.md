# Ethers Test
- this test represents a series of ethers-based operations
- you may use any code from this repository to understand how these trees work
- feel free to break out your pen and paper (they will be needed)

## Part 1: Read from the EVM (TypeScript)
- tools allowed
    - Text Editor or IDE
    - Command Line
    - Ethers (and any associated documentation)
    - TypeScript Interpretter
- write an algorithm to describe the tree starting at this root node: 0x007B70B97847701629A09cE796002300d6EcbeC9 (mumbai)
    - draw this tree to prove that your algorithm works
    - which nodes are frozen?

## Part 2: Write to the EVM (TypeScript)
- tools allowed
    - Text Editor or IDE
    - Command Line
    - Ethers (and any associated documentation)
    - TypeScript Interpretter
    - Etherscan
- deploy a new tree from: 0x6799db75a8164c674c0edd5f158a073b6fac5e42 (mumbai)
- remove the third child of the root node
- add a great grandchild to the middle child of the root node (level)
- freeze all the nodes of the tree

## Part 3: Visualize the EVM (Pseudocode)
- tools allowed
    - Etherscan
- how would you perform part 1 in the context of a tree-building website?
- how would you perform part 2 in the context of a tree-building website?
